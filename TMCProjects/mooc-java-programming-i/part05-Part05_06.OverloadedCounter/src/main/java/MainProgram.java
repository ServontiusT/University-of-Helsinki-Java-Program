The class must have the following constructors:

public Counter(int startValue) sets the start value of the counter to startValue.

public Counter() sets the start value of the counter to 0.

And the following methods:

public int value() returns the current value of the counter
public void increase() increases the value by 1
public void decrease() decreases the value by 1

public class MainProgram {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Test your counter here
    }
}
