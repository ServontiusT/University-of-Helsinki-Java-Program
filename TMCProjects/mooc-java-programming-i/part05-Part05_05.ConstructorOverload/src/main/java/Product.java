The exercise template has a class Product, which represents a product in a shop. Every product has a name, location and weight.

Add the following three constructors to the Product class:

public Product(String name) creates a product with the given name. Its location is set to "shelf" and its weight is set to 1.
public Product(String name, String location) creates a product with the given name and the given location. Its weight is set to 1.
public Product(String name, int weight) creates a product with the given name and the given weight. Its location is set to "shelf".
